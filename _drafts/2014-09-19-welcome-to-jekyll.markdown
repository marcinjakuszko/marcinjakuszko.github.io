You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve --watch`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight java %}
public static int findMin(int[] list)
	{	assert list != null && list.length > 0 : "failed precondition";

		int indexOfMin = 0;
		for(int i = 1; i < list.length; i++)
		{	if(list[i] < list[indexOfMin])
			{	indexOfMin = i;
			}
		}

		return indexOfMin;
	}
{% endhighlight %}
